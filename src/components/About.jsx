            For most people, flavour is an ingredient.
For Chef Arjun Sajnani, flavour has been a lifelong discipline — shaped across continents, kitchens, and decades of obsessive curiosity.
Long before Sunny’s became a Bangalore icon, Arjun’s world revolved around two great loves: food and theatre. After finishing school in Delhi, he left for the United States, studying English Literature and Drama at the University of the South in Tennessee — graduating with honours. But New York is where the spark truly caught fire. Working in some of the city’s finest restaurants, Arjun found himself drifting from the floor to the kitchen, learning the rhythms, rigor, and revelations of real American cuisine.
Those years built the palate, the precision, and the instinct that would later define Sunny’s.

       Back in 1995, after years in New York’s vibrant culinary world, Chef Arjun Sajnani returned to Bangalore with a vision — to create a space where flavour, authenticity, and simplicity came first. 
       That vision became Sunny’s, a restaurant that quickly earned a devoted following and a reputation for honest, ingredient-driven French-Italian cuisine.

Nearly three decades later, that legacy remains unchanged:
real food, crafted with real care, served without compromise.
It’s this very philosophy that now lives inside Sunny’s In A Bottle — a continuation of Arjun’s culinary journey, brought straight to your home.

 So it felt inevitable — almost overdue to bottle the flavours people kept coming back for.
During the pandemic, when the world paused, Arjun didn’t. He used the time to finally bring Sunny’s signature dressings, sauces, and marinades into people’s homes. Not as factory-made shortcuts, but as chef-crafted blends built on the same philosophy Sunny’s was founded on:
freshness, balance, purity, and flavour that never lies.

It is the restaurant — the legacy, the palate, the taste — distilled into drizzles, marinades, sauces, and moments.
